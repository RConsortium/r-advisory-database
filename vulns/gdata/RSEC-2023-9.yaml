id: RSEC-2023-9
details: Bundled Perl script Spreadsheet::ParseExcel version 0.65 is vulnerable to an arbitrary code execution (ACE)
  vulnerability due to passing unvalidated input from a file into a string-type "eval". Specifically, the issue stems
  from the evaluation of Number format strings (not to be confused with printf-style format strings) within the Excel
  parsing logic. Fixed with the depreation of Excel-related functionality from gdata version 3.0.0 -- upgrading advised.
