details: cmark-gfm, GitHub's extended version of the CommonMark library in C, suffers from multiple vulnerabilities
  affecting versions prior to 0.29.0.gfm.12. Various issues, including polynomial time complexity in multiple components
  like autolink extension, handle_close_bracket, and parsing of certain text patterns (leading `>`, `-`, `_`), may lead
  to unbounded resource exhaustion and denial of service. An out-of-bounds read in the `validate_protocol` function was
  also identified but is considered less harmful. Patches are available in versions 0.29.0.gfm.7, 0.29.0.gfm.10, and
  0.29.0.gfm.12. Upgrading is advised, and users unable to upgrade should validate input from trusted sources.
