details: cmark-gfm, GitHub's extended CommonMark library, has multiple vulnerabilities. Versions prior to 0.29.0.gfm.6
  suffer from a polynomial time complexity issue in the autolink extension, causing denial of service. Also, versions
  before 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21 contain an integer overflow in table row parsing, leading to heap corruption and
  potential Arbitrary Code Execution. Patches are available in versions 0.29.0.gfm.6, 0.29.0.gfm.3, and 0.28.3.gfm.21.
  Mitigations include upgrading or disabling affected extensions.
